FUZZYMANDIAS

Here's how it started (on #pinax-dev IRC on Freenode):
http://botland.oebfare.com/logger/pinax-dev/2010/01/29/

[16:34] ntoll: I was thinking it would be a good vehicle for explaining
Pinax/Django to a captive audience... I've asked an Australian geezer I meet in
Prague (James thingymajig or something) to perhaps talk at the dojo... he says
he knows a bit about Pinax. Might be an opportunity... 
[16:35] fuzzyman: you have to be careful with those Ozzies
[16:36] jtauber: :-)
[16:40] ntoll: fuzzyman: you mean like Ozzy Osborne, Ozzymandis (sic) etc...? 
[16:40] fuzzyman: definitely
[16:40] fuzzyman: all dodgy
[16:41] ntoll: fuzzymandis?
[16:41] ntoll: does that count..?
[16:42] jtauber: fuzzymandias â€” love it!
[16:48] ntoll: King of Coders am I, Fuzzymandias. If anyone would know how great
I am and where I submit-my-source-code, let him surpass one of my works!
[16:48] ntoll: that's the Shelly ruined... now onto the Smith... 
[16:49] jtauber: :-D



In Sourceforge's sandy silence, all alone,
Stands a gigantic repos, which far off throws
The only README the SCM knows:
"I am great FUZZYMANDIAS," saith the file,
"The King of Coders; this mighty build shows
"The wonders of my hand." The code's gone,
Nought but the .pyc remaining to disclose
The site of this forgotten Django App.
We wonder, and some Coder may express
Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness
Where Github stood, holding editor in chace,
He meets some fragments huge, and stops to guess
What powerful but unrecorded race
Once dwelt in that annihilated place.
