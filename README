In Sourceforge's sandy silence, all alone,
Stands a gigantic repos, which far off throws
The only README the SCM knows:
"I am great FUZZYMANDIAS," saith the file,
"The King of Coders; this mighty build shows
"The wonders of my hand." The code's gone,
Nought but the .pyc remaining to disclose
The site of this forgotten Django App.
We wonder, and some Coder may express
Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness
Where Github stood, holding editor in chace,
He meets some fragments huge, and stops to guess
What powerful but unrecorded race
Once dwelt in that annihilated place.
